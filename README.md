This is the source code for a blog that was made with a provided MVC broiler plate to learn to understand and to use the MVC pattern and object oriented PHP, as well as learning to use MySQL and the SQL language.

Just to make us think even harder, it was required to have both cathegories and tags â€“ because, who does not love SQL joins?

The development milieu was set up with Vagrant.
